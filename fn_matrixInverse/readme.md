# Field Composition 
* Branch: Diderot Dev:https://github.com/cchiw/Diderot-Dev
* Functionality: Matrix Inverse 
* Syntax: “inv()”
    - field#k(d)[i, j] → field#k(d)[i, j]
    - tensor[i, j] → tensor[i, j] 
* Text: Mentioned in dissertation-Design. 
* Issues: None
* Examples
    - Inverse of Negation  : X1
    - Hessian of Inverse  : X2
    - Inverse of Hessian Times another field  : X3
