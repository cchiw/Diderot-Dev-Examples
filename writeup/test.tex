\item[XT1]
One was in the creation of the \name{}  operator for the concat operator.
The indices on the terms in the concat \name{} operator were switched.
\item[XT2]
The bug arose when computing the determinant of the concatenation of a field.
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
  field#k(d)[2]F,G;
  field#k(d)[]H = det(concat(F,G));
\end{lstlisting}
The bug was caused by the rewriting system.
Our rewriting system applies index-based rewrites to reduce \name{} expressions. 
A specific index rewrite is applied when the index in the delta term matches an index in tensor (or field)  term.
The rewrite checked if two indices were equal and did not distinguish between variable and constant indices.
It is mathematically incorrect to reduce constant indices, because they are not equivalent to variable indices.
\item[X-3] Mistake in index scope when using substitution.
\begin{lstlisting}
field#k(2)[2,2] F0;
field#k(2)[2] F1;
field#k(2)[2] F2;
field#k(2)[2,2] G = (F0 $\circ$ F1) $\bullet$ F2;
\end{lstlisting}

There was a mistake in the substitution method.
The scope of the composition indices were handled incorrectly.
The following is the expected and observed representation of the computation in the \name{} IR.\\
Expected: $e=\sum_{\hat{j}} \expComp{A_{ij}}{B_i}{\beta} *C_j $\\
Observed: $e=\sum_{\hat{k}} \expComp{A_{ik}}{B_i}{\beta} *C_j$\\
in $\lambda(A,B,C)\EinExp{e}{\beta}$(F0,F1,F2). 
\item[XC4] Missing cases in split method.\\
Probes of a composition are handled differently before reconstruction.\\
$\sum F(x)$ and $\sum (\text{Comp} (F,G,-))(x)$.\\
Missing case in method leads to a compile time error.
Additionally (Comp(Comp -)-)
\item[XT5]  Differentiate a composition\\
The jacobian of a field composition:
\begin{lstlisting}
field#k(d1)[d] F0;
field#k(d)[d1] F1;
field#k(d1)[d,d1] G = $\nabla \otimes$ (F0 $\circ $ F1);
\end{lstlisting}
is represented as $\EinExp{\nabla_j (\text{Comp}(A_i,B_i,i))}{ij}$\\
In accordance with the chain rule ( (f $\circ $ g)' = (f'  $\circ $ g) $\cdot$ g') the rewriting system multiplies the inner derivative (g') with a new composition operation (f'  $\circ $ g).
In practice, the implementation does a point-wise multiplication when it should do an inner product.\\
 Expected: $\sum_{\hat{k}} (\expComp{\nabla_k A_i}{B_i}{\beta} * \nabla_j G_k) $\\
Observed: $\expComp{\nabla_j  A_{\beta}}{B_i}{ i} * (\nabla_j G_i)$\\
in $\lambda(A,B)\EinExp{e}{ij}$(F0,F1). 
\item[XT6]
Using If Wrapper with other field operators
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
field#4(2)[]G = compose(minF((F0),(F1)),(F2*0.1));
\end{lstlisting}
Field operators need to be applied to the leaves in if wrapper. 
The composition is a field operator so it needed to be pushed to the leaves.
$$(\text{If}(c, e3,e4)) \circ es  
\rightarrow
\text{If}(c, e3  \circ es ,e4 \circ es) $$
