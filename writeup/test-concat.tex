One was in the creation of the \name{}  operator for the concat operator.
The indices on the terms in the concat \name{} operator were switched.
\item[XT2]
The bug arose when computing the determinant of the concatenation of a field.
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
  field#k(d)[2]F,G;
  field#k(d)[]H = det(concat(F,G));
\end{lstlisting}
The bug was caused by the rewriting system.
Our rewriting system applies index-based rewrites to reduce \name{} expressions. 
A specific index rewrite is applied when the index in the delta term matches an index in tensor (or field)  term.
The rewrite checked if two indices were equal and did not distinguish between variable and constant indices.
It is mathematically incorrect to reduce constant indices, because they are not equivalent to variable indices.
