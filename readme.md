#  Design, Implementation, and Testing of new language features for Diderot
* Composition of fields	      
    - Directory "composition"
    - ex. f= f0â—¦f1
* Concatenation of fields     
    - Directory "concatenation"
    - ex. f = concat(f0,f1)
* Field Selection 	
    - Directory "selection"
    - ex. f = selection(2, [f1,f2,f3,f4]) -> f2
* Inverse 
    - Directory "matrixInverse"
* Text  
    - Document  writeup/paper.pdf
    - Describes design of EIN IR, implementation, and bugs found by DATm

## Still to Oraganize 
*  Organized by topic 
    - Definine fields as polys    ex. f = x^2+y^2
    - Constructive Solid Geometry ex. f= max(f0,f1)
    - Lerp/Clerp/Clamp  in "other/"
