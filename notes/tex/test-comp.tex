\item[Comp-B1] Mistake in index scope when using substitution.
\begin{lstlisting}
field#k(2)[2,2] F0;
field#k(2)[2] F1;
field#k(2)[2] F2;
field#k(2)[2,2] G = (F0 $\circ$ F1) $\bullet$ F2;
\end{lstlisting}

There was a mistake in the substitution method.
The scope of the composition indices were handled incorrectly.
The following is the expected and observed representation of the computation in the \name{} IR.\\
Expected: $e=\sum_{\hat{j}} \expComp{A_{ij}}{B_i}{\beta} *C_j $\\
Observed: $e=\sum_{\hat{k}} \expComp{A_{ik}}{B_i}{\beta} *C_j$\\
in $\lambda(A,B,C)\EinExp{e}{\beta}$(F0,F1,F2). \\

\item[Comp-B2] Missing cases in split method.\\
Probes of a composition are handled differently before reconstruction.\\
$\sum F(x)$ and $\sum (\text{Comp} (F,G,-))(x)$.\\
Missing case in method leads to a compile time error.
Additionally (Comp(Comp -)-)\\

\item[Comp-B3]  Differentiate a composition\\
The jacobian of a field composition:
\begin{lstlisting}
field#k(d1)[d] F0;
field#k(d)[d1] F1;
field#k(d1)[d,d1] G = $\nabla \otimes$ (F0 $\circ $ F1);
\end{lstlisting}
is represented as $\EinExp{\nabla_j (\text{Comp}(A_i,B_i,i))}{ij}$\\
In accordance with the chain rule ( (f $\circ $ g)' = (f'  $\circ $ g) $\cdot$ g') the rewriting system multiplies the inner derivative (g') with a new composition operation (f'  $\circ $ g).
In practice, the implementation does a point-wise multiplication when it should do an inner product.\\
 Expected: $\sum_{\hat{k}} (\expComp{\nabla_k A_i}{B_i}{\beta} * \nabla_j G_k) $\\
Observed: $\expComp{\nabla_j  A_{\beta}}{B_i}{ i} * (\nabla_j G_i)$\\
in $\lambda(A,B)\EinExp{e}{ij}$(F0,F1).
